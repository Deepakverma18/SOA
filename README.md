# SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)

>## Introduction to Service-Oriented Architecture

* **Service-Oriented Architecture(SOA)** is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.
* Its principles are totally independent of vendors and all the other technologies .
* **In Service-Oriented Architecture**, a lot of services are communicated with each other,in following two ways:one is passing through the data or through two or more services that coordinate an activity.

>## **Characteristics of Service-Oriented Architecture ?**

* For defining the concepts of Service-Oriented Architecture it varies from company to company, there are six major key tenets by which service-oriented architecture is majored and these are :
   1. Business value
   2. Intrinsic Inter-operability
   3. Strategic goals
   4. Shared services
   5. Flexibility
   6. Evolutionary refinement

* Each of these core values are seen on a continuum from the older format distributing computing to the Service-Oriented Architecture to cloud computing .

* There are three roles in each of the Service-Oriented Architecture building blocks and these are: service broker, service provider, service registry, service repository, and service requester/consumer .
  1. **Service Provider** - Service Provider works with service registry,debating about the whys and how the services will be offered, such as security , availability, what to charge and more . The role of service provider also determines the service category and if there are need to be any trading agreements .
  2. **Service Broker** - Service Broker will collect information regarding the services that are available for those who are requesting for it.
  3. **Service Requester** - The work of service request is to locate entries int the broker Registry and the bind all of them to the service provider.

>## **Implementing Service-Oriented Architecture**

* There are wide range of technologies from which any one can be selected and then implemented it with Service-Oriented Architecture(SOA), depending on what your end goal is and what you're trying to accomplish .
* Normally, Service-Oriented Architecture is implemented with web services, that makes the function building blocks accessible over standard internet protocols.
* If we imagine any example of web services, then we have SOAP , which stands for Simple Object Access Protocol . If we talk about what is SOAP , so SOAP is messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks .

>## **Some Final Thoughts On Service-Oriented Architecture** 

* As above discussed we can see, how service-oriented architecture can be to understand but once you will know about it, the nuts and the bolt of it then it will benefits the company and you will be thrilled you discovered it .
* So, we have provided several excellent resources about Service-Oriented architecture through out this article.
