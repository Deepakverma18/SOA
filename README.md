# SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)

## Introduction to Service-Oriented Architecture

* **Service-Oriented Architecture(SOA)** is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.
* Its principles are independent of vendors and all the other technologies.
* **In Service-Oriented Architecture**, a lot of services are communicated with each other, in the following two ways: one is passing through the data or through two or more services that coordinate an activity.

## **Characteristics of Service-Oriented Architecture ?**

* For defining the concepts of Service-Oriented Architecture it varies from company to company, there are six major key tenets by which service-oriented architecture majors and these are :
   1. Business value
   2. Intrinsic Inter-operability
   3. Strategic goals
   4. Shared services
   5. Flexibility
   6. Evolutionary refinement

* Each of these core values is seen on a continuum from the older format distributing computing to the Service-Oriented Architecture to cloud computing.

## **Service-Oriented Architecture Patterns**

* There are three roles in each of the Service-Oriented Architecture building blocks and these are  - service broker, service provider, service registry, service repository, and service requester/consumer.
  1. **Service Provider** - Service Provider works with service registry, debating about the whys and how the services will be offered, such as security, availability, what to charge and, more. The role of the service provider also determines the service category and if there are need to be any trading agreements.
  2. **Service Broker** - Service Broker will collect information regarding the services that are available for those who are requested for it.
  3. **Service Requester** - The work of service requests is to locate entries in the broker Registry and bind all of them to the service provider.

## **Implementing Service-Oriented Architecture**

* There is a wide range of technologies from which anyone can be selected and then implemented with Service-Oriented Architecture(SOA), depending on what your end goal is and what you're trying to accomplish.
* Normally, Service-Oriented Architecture is implemented with web services, which makes the function building blocks accessible over standard internet protocols.
* If we imagine any example of web services, then we have SOAP, which stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. If we talk about what is SOAP, SOAP is messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.

## **Why Service-Oriented Architecture is Important**

* There are many benefits of using service-oriented architecture, especially in web service-based businesses. We'll see some of those benefits below-

    1. Most important use is by Service-Oriented Architecture we can create reusable code, and by this time consumption will be less in the development process.
    2. By the use of it we can promote interaction with the help of it, we will put a standard form of communication so that various systems and platforms function independently of each other.
    3. By use of Service-Oriented Architecture we can reduce costs. With help of this, we can maintain a desired level of output. By this many businesses will limit the amount of analysis required when developing custom solutions.

## **Some Final Thoughts On Service-Oriented Architecture**

* As above discussed we can see, how service-oriented architecture can be too difficult to understand but once you will know about it, the nuts and the bolt of it then it will benefit the company and you will be thrilled you discovered it.
* So, we have provided several excellent resources about Service-Oriented architecture throughout this article.
