># SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)

>## Introduction to Service-Oriented Architecture

* **Service-Oriented Architecture(SOA)** is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.
* Its principles are totally independent of vendors and all the other technologies .
* **In Service-Oriented Architecture**, a lot of services are communicated with each other,in following two ways:one is passing through the data or through two or more services that coordinate an activity.

>## **Characterists of Service-Oriented Architecture ?**

* For defining the concepts of Service-Oriented Architecture it varies from company to company, there are six makoj key tenets by which service-oriented architecture is majored and these are :
   1. Business value
   2. Intrinsic inter-operability
   3. Strategic goals
   4. Shared services
   5. Flexibility
   6. Evolutionary refinement

* Each of these core values are seen on a continuum from the older format distributing computing to the Service-Oriented Architecture to cloud computing .

* There are three roles in each of the Service-Oriented Architecture building blocks and these are: service broker, service provider, service registry, service repository, and service requester/consumer .
  1. **Service Provider** - Service Provider works with service registry,debating about the whys and how the services will be offered, such as security , availability, waht to charge and more . The role of service provider also determines the service category and if there are need to be any trading agreements .
  2. **Service Broker** - Service Broker will collect information regarding the services that are available for those who are requesting for it.
  3. **Service Requester** - The work of service requeser is to locate entries int the broker registery and the bind all of them to the service provider.
